# Timer Ninja
Timer Ninja is a brainless Java library to evaluate your Java code method execution time.
Timer Ninja follows the Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) concept, backed by AspectJ, to make it super simple
to declare tracker on method.

## Problem Space
Measuring the method execution time is a super common thing in the programmer world.

### Traditional approach
The traditional approach is to get the different between two timestamp points before and after the method is executed.
This approach is obviously fast and easy, but will soon become messy because you will need to manually declare 2 timestamp points
around every method that need to be evaluated. This introduces a lot of boilerplate code in the code base.

```java
long beforeExecution = System.currentTimeMillis();
doSomethingInteresting();
long afterExecution = System.currentTimeMillis();
System.out.println("Execution time (ms): " + (afterExecution - beforeExecution));
```

### Timer Ninja approach
Timer Ninja library take the AOP approach with AspectJ under the hood. All you need to do, is to simply
annotate the method you would want to measure the execution time with `@TimerNinjaTracker` annotation.

```java
@TimerNinjaTracker
public String doSomethingInteresting() {
     
}
```

Timer Ninja also keeps track of method execution context. If your annotated method is called from the parent method, which also has the 
`@TimerNinjaTracker` declared, then the execution order and relationship of the methods will be preserved in a tracking output.

**Example Timer Ninja trace output**  
```shell
Timer Ninja trace context id: 851ac23b-2669-4883-8c97-032b8fd2d45c
Trace timestamp: 2023-04-03T07:16:48.491Z
{===== Start of trace context id: 851ac23b-2669-4883-8c97-032b8fd2d45c =====}
public void requestMoneyTransfer(int sourceUserId, int targetUserId, int amount) - 1747 ms
   |-- public User findUser(int userId) - 105000 Âµs
   |-- public void processPayment(User user, int amount) - 770 ms
     |-- public boolean changeAmount(User user, int amount) - 306 ms
     |-- public void notify(User user) - 258 ms
       |-- private void notifyViaSMS(User user) - 53 ms
       |-- private void notifyViaEmail(User user) - 205 ms
{====== End of trace context id: 851ac23b-2669-4883-8c97-032b8fd2d45c ======}
```

## Installation
For this to work, you will need to do two thing: declare a dependency of `timer-ninja`, and a plugin to compile
the aspect defined in `timer-ninja` dependency

I'm working very hard to ship this library to the Maven central repository

### Declare dependency on timer-ninja
**Gradle**  
```groovy
implementation group: 'com.github.thanglequoc', name: 'timer-ninja', version: '1.1-SNAPSHOT'
```

**Maven**  
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.thanglequoc</groupId>
    <artifactId>timer-ninja</artifactId>
    <version>1.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Declare plugin to compile the aspect
**Gradle**  
You can use the [FreeFair AspectJ Gradle plugin](https://github.com/freefair/gradle-plugins)

Example project's `build.gradle`:

```groovy
plugins {
    // ...
    id "io.freefair.aspectj.post-compile-weaving" version '6.6.3'
}

dependencies {
    // ...
    // Timer ninja dependency
    implementation group: 'com.github.thanglequoc', name: 'timer-ninja', version: '1.1-SNAPSHOT'
    aspect 'com.github.thanglequoc:timer-ninja:1.1-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

### Maven project
You can use the [Mojo's AspectJ Plugin](https://www.mojohaus.org/aspectj-maven-plugin/index.html)  
Example project's `pom.xml`

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.aspectj</groupId>
        <artifactId>aspectjrt</artifactId>
        <version>1.9.7</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.thanglequoc</groupId>
        <artifactId>timer-ninja</artifactId>
        <version>1.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
        <scope>compile</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>

<build>
    <plugins>
        <!-- Codehaus Maven plugin -->
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
            <artifactId>aspectj-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>1.14.0</version>
            <configuration>
                <complianceLevel>11</complianceLevel>
                <source>11</source>
                <target>11</target>
                <!-- Specify timer-ninja as the aspect library -->
                <aspectLibraries>
                    <aspectLibrary>
                        <groupId>com.github.thanglequoc</groupId>
                        <artifactId>timer-ninja</artifactId>
                    </aspectLibrary>
                </aspectLibraries>
            </configuration>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <goals>
                        <goal>compile</goal>
                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

### Getting the time trace output
The library is logging the time trace with [SLF4J Logger](https://www.slf4j.org/). So if you've already had an Slf4j provider (e.g: Logback, Log4J) in your project, then
you should be able to see the time trace output after the method executed.  
Otherwise, you will need to add a log provider into the project, my personal recommendation is [Logback](https://logback.qos.ch/) for 
robustness and simplicity. You can refer to this [Logback tutorial from Baeldung](https://www.baeldung.com/logback)

See this [Slf4j manual](https://slf4j.org/manual.html) for how to configure your logging framework with Slf4j

**Note**: Spring Boot project uses Logback as it default log provider, so you don't need to do anything here.

If logging framework is not your preference, and you just want to have a quick result. Then you can choose to fall back
to the good old `System.out.println` output by executing this code **once** (since this is a singleton configuration instance). This setting will instruct
Timer Ninja to also print the time trace output to `System.out`

```java
TimerNinjaConfiguration.getInstance().toggleSystemOutLog(true);
```

## Usage
Now that you're all set and ready to go. Just simply place the tracker by annotating `@TimerNinjaTracker` on any method/constructor
that you want to measure

```java
@TimerNinjaTracker
public String placeOrder(Order order) {
     
}
```

By default, the time unit of the tracker is **millisecond (ms)**. You can freely choose other timeunit with the parameter within the annotation
```java
import java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit;

@TimerNinjaTracker(timeUnit = ChronoUnit.MICROS)
public String placeOrder(Order order) {

}
```

### Reading the time trace output
Once the method is executed, you should be able to find the result similar to this one in the output/log

```log
2023-04-06T21:27:50.878+07:00  INFO 14796 --- [nio-8080-exec-1] c.g.t.timerninja.TimerNinjaUtil          : Timer Ninja trace context id: c9ffeb39-3457-48d4-9b73-9ffe7d612165
